        rollout it belongs to — so an estimator's per-rollout advantage can be scattered back to
        all of its steps. Without ids (legacy path) each sample is its own rollout and prompt.

        Example — two experiences, rollout "A" has 2 steps, "B" has 1, "C" has 2:
            e0.rollout_ids = ["A", "A", "B"]   e1.rollout_ids = ["C", "C"]

        After concat the 5 samples are [A, A, B, C, C]; merging by first-seen rollout_id gives
            rewards           = [1.0, 0.0, 0.5]   # (R=3) one per unique rollout A, B, C
